## Implementation details of forntend part

**LibraryManagementSystemApplication** -> **MainController** -> **LoginServlet** -> **logIn.html** or **signUp.html** -> **script.js** (calls `LoginServlet` or `SignUpServlet`) -> **login/signup tables** (in database) -> **Successful Login** -> **Swagger page to access APIs**

1. **LibraryManagementSystemApplication**:
- This is the main entry point of the application. It handles the initialization of controllers and servlets.

2. **MainController**:
- The main controller routes requests to the appropriate servlets. When a user tries to log in, the request is routed to the `LoginServlet`.

3. **LoginServlet**:
- This servlet handles user login functionality.
- If the user is **not signed in**, it forwards the request to the `logIn.html` page.
- If the user is **not registered**, the system displays a sign-up option, linking to `signUp.html`.

4. **logIn.html** and **signUp.html**:
- `logIn.html` is shown for users attempting to log in.
- `signUp.html` is shown for new users who need to register.

5. **script.js**:
- This JavaScript file handles the submission of login and signup details.
- It calls the appropriate servlet (either `LoginServlet` or `SignUpServlet`) to process the credentials and store them in the `login` and `signup` tables in the database.

6. **Handling Login and Signup**:
- **LoginServlet**: Handles the login details submitted via `logIn.html`. It checks the credentials in the `login` table.
- **SignUpServlet**: Processes new user details submitted via `signUp.html`, and stores them in the `signup` table.

7. **Login Success**:
- If the login is **successful**, the user is redirected to the **Swagger page**, which provides access to the APIs of the Library Management System.

## API Overview

This Library Management System is built using Java and Spring Boot, designed to efficiently manage books, authors, and publishers within a library. The project leverages an Oracle database for data storage and utilizes JDBC Template for database connectivity.

### Flow for Using APIs:
- **Hit the API in Swagger** -> **Test It Out** -> **Read the Instructions** -> **Give Parameters** (if required) -> **Click on Execute** -> **Observe the Response** (200 for success).

## Implementation details of backend part
- Model -> Controller -> Service -> Repository

### Models

**Definition:** Models represent the data structure of the application. They define the attributes and relationships between different entities.

- **Book**: Contains attributes like `id` (primary key), `name`, `price`, etc., to represent book details.
- **Author**: Contains attributes like `id` and `name` (composite key), `contact`, etc. This ensures unique identification in conjunction with the `id` of the Book.
- **Publisher**: Contains attributes like `id` and `name` (composite key), `contact`, etc. This also ensures unique identification in conjunction with the `id` of the Book.

### Controllers

**Definition:** Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses. They define the API endpoints and manage the interaction between the user interface and the application’s business logic.

- **BookController**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for operations related to `Book` entities, including:
  - **POST**: Create a new book.
  - **GET**: Retrieve books (all, by ID, or by name).
  - **PUT**: Update an existing book.
  - **PATCH**: Partially update a book.
  - **DELETE**: Remove a book.

- **AuthorController**: Similar operations for managing `Author` entities.
- **PublisherController**: Similar operations for managing `Publisher` entities.

### Services

**Definition:** Services encapsulate the business logic of the application. They act as an intermediary between the controllers and repositories, handling data manipulation and processing.

- **BookService**: Contains methods to manage business operations related to `Book` entities, such as validation and transaction handling.
- **AuthorService**: Manages operations related to `Author` entities, including data processing and business rules.
- **PublisherService**: Handles business logic for `Publisher` entities.

This separation facilitates easier testing and maintenance.

### Repositories

**Definition:** Repositories are responsible for data access and interaction with the database. They provide methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **BookRepository**: Interface for accessing and managing `Book` entities in the database.
- **AuthorRepository**: Interface for accessing and managing `Author` entities.
- **PublisherRepository**: Interface for accessing and managing `Publisher` entities.

Each repository abstracts the underlying database operations, ensuring that the data layer is isolated from the rest of the application, promoting better separation of concerns.

## Database Connectivity

The project connects to an Oracle database using JDBC Template. This allows efficient execution of SQL queries and provides an easy-to-use interface for database operations. Configuration details are specified in the application properties file.

---

## Swagger Integration

Swagger is integrated into the project to provide interactive API documentation. This allows developers to explore the available endpoints and understand the expected request/response formats without needing additional tools.

---

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed via `pom.xml`, which includes necessary libraries for Spring Boot, Oracle JDBC, and Swagger. This ensures that the project is modular and easy to maintain.

---

## Spring Boot Annotations

Spring Boot is used to simplify the development process through annotations like `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Autowired`. These annotations enable auto-configuration and dependency injection, making it easier to create standalone applications with minimal setup.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your Oracle database and update the connection details in `application.properties`.
3. Run the application using your IDE or the command line.
4. signup and then login using  `http://localhost:8080/lms`, to access the APIs.

## Conclusion

This Library Management System is designed to be a robust, scalable solution for managing library resources. Its architecture supports easy modifications and enhancements, making it a great foundation for future development.
